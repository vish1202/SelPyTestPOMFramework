# SelPyTestPOMFramework
Selenium Python Framework with Pytest and POM Concept
1) Selenium python framework developed from scratch with PyTest and POM Concepts.
2) Common methods available under utilities
3) Handled dependencies using pytest-depends fixtures. Tests can run/skip based on dependency of other tests and can run in parallel as well.
4) Added seperate markers for tests to run as per tags/markers provided by user
5) Added logging for better readibility on how the tests are performing
6) Added HTML reporting to review all tests results with screenshots for failures
